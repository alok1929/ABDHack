# HACKATHON - SPOTIFY+BULB DASHBOARD

## Discussions:
- Converting it to react js seems like a feasible option but it is hard to do. Something to talk about
- how to use the model with our code because we are using plain html, which is why again I want to use reactjs. should see how it all works with tensorflow.js

# Todo:

### SPOTIFY:
- Save images for pause, play and current
- Train the model 
- Pause play and get current with the model 

- Add tailwindcss with react or without, and make it look better
 (this can be done on the day of the hackathon)

### BULB:
- Make the bulb turn on and off with code
- train a model for the bulb 
- make the bulb turn on and off with the model


### THINGS THAT ARE DONE:
- pause play without the model 
-
